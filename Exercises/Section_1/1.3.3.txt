## Try to decompile and explore additional .NET and Java compiled files in order to become more

find a large collection of JAR files in the C:\Program Files
(x86)\ManageEngine\AppManager12\working\classes directory, while on the DNN box, you can
find .NET managed modules in the C:\inetpub\wwwroot\dotnetnuke\bin directory

Done!
